# Api integration

<p>  there are 2 main wais we can customize and  expand our Pipefy experience</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Public GraphQl Api</dt>
  <dd>take advantage of Pipefy`s graphql api from within your app with requests</dd>
  <dt>PipefyApp</dt>
  <dd>run an app from within the pipefy platform.</dd>
  <dd>even though you may still make use of the public APi you now have access to the PpefyApp client which goes a long way on
its own.

</dd>

</dl>

[^1]: in order to have an elastic dynamic inclusion of data may it be through a third party api ou own onbording or directly in pipefy. critereas.
